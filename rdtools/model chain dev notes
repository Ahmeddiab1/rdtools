model chain dev notes

To do:
Default behaviour: interpolate to the representative timestep. print a message if not value passed
consider how to leave room for model provided instead of POA, temp etc.
Look at the plotting module
Consider using different instances of the class for clearsky, sensor etc.

Ask about additional spare prison modules


changes to clearsky from notebook:

use apparent zenith for transposition: should be changed in the non-clearsky also
filter should go off of poa rather than insolation
Albedo can and should be included (should change in the non-clearsky part of the notebook too)
